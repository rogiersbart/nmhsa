The {[nmhsa](https://rogiersbart.github.io/nmhsa)} R package provides an R
wrapper around the [NMHSA Python
implementation](https://github.com/LaLemmens/NHM-SA) by [Lemmens *et al.*
(2019)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.053316) for
performing porous media reconstruction using an advanced simulated annealing
approach.

# Install

You can install the latest version of
{[nmhsa](https://rogiersbart.github.io/nmhsa)} with the following:

``` r
if (!require(pak)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rogiersbart/nmhsa")
```

# Use

To run the algorithms from the examples in the original Python code, you at
least need a 2D array as training image, and resort to the `hsa()`, `mhsa()` or
`nmhsa()` functions, through which the algorithms are exposed to the R user.
Hyperparameters and corresponding defaults have been thorougly revised, so we
recommend you read the help pages of these functions in detail. For making use
of the nesting available in `nmhsa()`, the training image has to be processed,
and one or two modified versions of the image have to be provided as well.
Here's a minimal `hsa()` example with the `cement` training image provided in the
package:

```{r}
library(nmhsa)
reconstruction <- hsa(cement)
plot(cement, reconstruction)
```

For more information, refer to `vignette("nmhsa")`.

# Note

This package depends on {reticulate} and Python, and hence a functional Python
installation is required on your machine. If you don't have anything like that,
{reticulate} will normally solve that for you.
